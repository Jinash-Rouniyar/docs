import SkipLink from "/src/components/SkipValidationLink";

A **collection definition** outlines the structure, indexing, and behavior of a group of data objects in Weaviate. This reference section details the available parameters for configuring a collection.

## Collection Parameters

These are the top-level parameters you can set when creating a collection.

| Parameter             | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                      |

### `class`

The `class` is the name of the collection.

The collection name starts with an upper case letter. The upper case letter distinguishes collection names from primitive data types when the name is used as a property value.

Consider these examples that use the `dataType` property:

- `dataType: ["text"]` is a `text` data type.
- `dataType: ["Text"]` is a cross-reference type to a collection named `Text`.

After the first letter, collection names may use any GraphQL-compatible characters.

The collection name validation regex is `/^[A-Z][_0-9A-Za-z]*$/`.

import InitialCaps from "/_includes/schemas/initial-capitalization.md";

<InitialCaps />

### Mutability

Some, but not all, parameters are mutable after you create your collection. To modify immutable parameters, export your data, create a new collection, and import your data into it.

<details>
  <summary>Mutable parameters</summary>

import RaftRFChangeWarning from "/_includes/1-25-replication-factor.mdx";

<!-- Note: remove below "(not mutable in `v1.25`)" note when the feature is released. -->

<RaftRFChangeWarning />

import CollectionMutableParameters from "/_includes/collection-mutable-parameters.mdx";

<CollectionMutableParameters />

</details>

After you create a collection, you can add new properties. You cannot modify existing properties after you create the collection. You can also [add new named vectors](./vectorization.mdx#adding-a-named-vector-after-collection-creation).

## Auto-schema

The "Auto-schema" feature generates a collection definition automatically by inferring parameters from data being added. It is enabled by default, and can be disabled (e.g. in `docker-compose.yml`) by setting the environment variable [`AUTOSCHEMA_ENABLED`](/docs/deploy/configuration/env-vars/index.md#AUTOSCHEMA_ENABLED) to `'false'`.

It will:

- Create a collection if an object is added to a non-existent collection.
- Add any missing property from an object being added.
- Infer array data types, such as `int[]`, `text[]`, `number[]`, `boolean[]`, `date[]` and `object[]`.
- Infer nested properties for `object` and `object[]` data types (introduced in `v1.22.0`).
- Throw an error if an object being added contains a property that conflicts with an existing schema type. (e.g. trying to import text into a field that exists in the schema as `int`).

:::tip Define the collection manually for production use

Generally speaking, we recommend that you disable auto-schema for production use.

- A manual collection definition will provide more precise control.
- There is a performance penalty associated with inferring the data structure at import time. This may be a costly operation in some cases, such as complex nested properties.

:::

#### Auto-schema data types

Additional configurations are available to help the auto-schema infer properties to suit your needs.

- `AUTOSCHEMA_DEFAULT_NUMBER=number` - create `number` columns for any numerical values (as opposed to `int`, etc).
- `AUTOSCHEMA_DEFAULT_DATE=date` - create `date` columns for any date-like values.

The following are not allowed:

- Any map type is forbidden, unless it clearly matches one of the two supported types `phoneNumber` or `geoCoordinates`.
- Any array type is forbidden, unless it is clearly a reference-type. In this case, Weaviate needs to resolve the beacon and see what collection the resolved beacon is from, since it needs the collection name to be able to alter the schema.

## Collections count limit {#collections-count-limit}

:::info Added in `v1.30`
:::

To ensure optimal performance, Weaviate **limits the number of collections per node**. Each collection adds overhead in terms of indexing, definition management, and storage. This limit aims to ensure Weaviate remains performant.

- **Default limit**: `1000` collections.
- **Modify the limit**: Use the [`MAXIMUM_ALLOWED_COLLECTIONS_COUNT`](/deploy/configuration/env-vars/index.md#MAXIMUM_ALLOWED_COLLECTIONS_COUNT) environment variable to adjust the collection count limit.

:::note
If your instance already exceeds the limit, Weaviate will not allow the creation of any new collections. Existing collections will not be deleted.
:::

:::tip
**Instead of raising the collections count limit, consider rethinking your architecture**.
For more details, see [Starter Guides: Scaling limits with collections](../../starter-guides/managing-collections/collections-scaling-limits.mdx).

## Collection aliases

:::caution Technical preview

Collection aliases were added in **`v1.32`** as a **technical preview**.<br/><br/>
This means that the feature is still under development and may change in future releases, including potential breaking changes.
**We do not recommend using this feature in production environments at this time.**

:::

Collection aliases are alternative names for Weaviate collections that allow you to reference a collection by an alternative name.

Weaviate automatically routes alias requests to the target collection. This allows you to use aliases wherever collection names are required. This includes [collection management](../../manage-collections/index.mdx), [queries](../../search/index.mdx), and all other operations requiring a specific collection name with the **exception** of deleting collections. To delete a collection you need to use its name. Deleting a collection does not automatically delete aliases pointing to it.

Alias names must be unique (can't match existing collections or other aliases) and multiple aliases can point to the same collection. You can set up collection aliases [programmatically through client libraries](../../manage-collections/collection-aliases.mdx) or by using the <SkipLink href="/weaviate/api/rest#tag/aliases">REST endpoints</SkipLink>.

In order to manage collection aliases, you need to posses the right [`Collection aliases`](../../configuration/rbac/index.mdx#available-permissions) permissions. To manage the underlying collection the alias references, you also need the [`Collections`](../../configuration/rbac/index.mdx#available-permissions) permissions for that specific collection.
