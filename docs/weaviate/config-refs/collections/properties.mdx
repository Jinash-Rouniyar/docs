**Properties** define the data structure of the objects within your collection. Each property is an object within the `properties` array of the collection definition, specifying a field's name, data type, and indexing behavior.


## Adding a property after collection creation

Adding a property after importing objects can lead to limitations in inverted-index related behavior, such as filtering by the new property's length or null status.

This is caused by the inverted index being built at import time. If you add a property after importing objects, the inverted index for metadata such as the length or the null status will not be updated to include the new properties. This means that the new property will not be indexed for existing objects. This can lead to unexpected behavior when querying.

To avoid this, you can either:

- Add the property before importing objects.
- Delete the collection, re-create it with the new property and then re-import the data.

We are working on a re-indexing API to allow you to re-index the data after adding a property. This will be available in a future release.
