title: Multi-tenancy
description: Reference for multi-tenancy in Weaviate.
---

Multi-tenancy allows you to isolate data within a single collection, where objects are associated with specific tenants. This is a useful feature for building SaaS applications or any system requiring strict data partitioning.

:::note Why use multi-tenancy?

It provides data isolation at a lower overhead than creating a separate collection for each tenant, making it more scalable when you have a large number of tenants.

:::

To enable multi-tenancy, set the `enabled` key to `true` in the `multiTenancyConfig` object. This parameter is immutable and must be set at creation time.
