title: Vectorization
description: Reference for configuring vectorizers and named vectors in Weaviate.
---

**Vectorization** is the process of converting data into numerical vector embeddings. Weaviate can automate this process using vectorizer modules. This page covers how to configure the vectorizer and manage vector embeddings for a collection.

## Single vector collections

If you don't explicitly define a [named vector](#named-vectors) in your collection definition, Weaviate automatically creates what's known as a *single vector* collection. These vectors are stored internally under the named vector `default` (which is a reserved vector name).

To learn which properties of your data are vectorized, refer to the [Configure semantic indexing](#configure-semantic-indexing) section.

#### Vectorization Behavior

Within `moduleConfig`, you can control how the vector is generated:

- **`vectorizeClassName`** (Boolean, default `true`): If `true`, the collection's name is included in the text that gets vectorized.
- At the property level, you can also set `moduleConfig` to:
  - **`skip`** (Boolean, default `false`): If `true`, this property's content is **not** included in the vectorization.
  - **`vectorizePropertyName`** (Boolean, default `false`): If `true`, the property's name is included along with its value in the text that gets vectorized.

By default, Weaviate vectorizes all `text` and `text[]` properties, concatenates their values alphabetically, prepends the collection name, and converts the resulting string to lowercase before sending it to the vectorizer.

Collections can have multiple named vectors.

The vectors in a collection can have their own configurations. Each vector space can set its own index, its own compression algorithm, and its own vectorizer. This means you can use different vectorization models, and apply different distance metrics, to the same object.

To work with named vectors, adjust your queries to specify a target vector for [vector search](/weaviate/search/similarity#named-vectors) or [hybrid search](/weaviate/search/hybrid#named-vectors) queries.

## Syntax

Single vector collections are valid and continue to use the original collection syntax. However, if you configure multiple vector embeddings, you must use the new, named vector syntax to query your collections.

### Collection definition

Use the collection definition to [configure the vector spaces](../../manage-collections/vector-config.mdx#define-named-vectors) for each data object.

:::info Adding named vectors to existing collections
Currently, it is only possible to [add new named vectors](../../manage-collections/vector-config.mdx#add-new-named-vectors) to collections that were initially configured to use named vectors. 
:::

### Query a named vector

To do a vector search on a collection with named vectors, specify the vector space to search.

Use named vectors with [vector similarity searches](/weaviate/search/similarity#named-vectors) (`near_text`, `near_object`, `near_vector`, `near_image`) and [hybrid search](/weaviate/search/hybrid#named-vectors).

Named vector collections support hybrid search, but only for one vector at a time.

[Keyword search](/weaviate/search/bm25) syntax does not change if a collection has named vectors.

### Query multiple named vectors

:::info Added in `v1.26`
:::

Where multiple named vectors are defined in a collection, you can query them in a single search. This is useful for comparing the similarity of an object to multiple named vectors.

This is called a "multi-target vector search".

In a multi-target vector search, you can specify:

- The target vectors to search
- The query(ies) to compare to the target vectors
- The weights to apply to each distance (raw, or normalized) for each target vector

Read more in [How-to: Multi-target vector search](../../search/multi-vector.md).

### Adding a named vector after collection creation

:::info Added in `v1.31`
:::

A named vector can be added to an existing collection definition after collection creation. This allows you to add new vector representations for objects without having to delete and recreate the collection.

When you add a new named vector to an existing collection definition, it's important to understand that **existing objects' new named vector will remain unpopulated**. Only objects created or updated after the named vector addition will receive these new vector embeddings.

This prevents any unintended side effects, such as incurring large vectorization time or costs for all existing objects in a collection.

If you want to populate the new named vector for existing objects, update the object with the existing object UUID and vectors. This will trigger the vectorization process for the new named vector.

<!-- TODO: I wonder we should show an example - maybe once the vectorizer syntax is updated with 1.32 -->

:::caution Not available for legacy (unnamed) vectorizers
The ability to add a named vector after collection creation is only available for collections configured with named vectors.
