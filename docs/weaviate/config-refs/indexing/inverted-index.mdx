The **inverted index** is a crucial component in Weaviate that maps values (like words or numbers) to the objects that contain them. It is the backbone for all attribute-based filtering (`where` filters) and keyword searching (`bm25`, `hybrid`).

### Inverted index types

Multiple [inverted index types](../../concepts/indexing/inverted-index.md) are available in Weaviate. Not all inverted index types are available for all data types. The available inverted index types are:

import InvertedIndexTypesSummary from "/_includes/inverted-index-types-summary.mdx";

<InvertedIndexTypesSummary />

- Enable one or both of `indexFilterable` and `indexRangeFilters` to index a property for faster filtering.
  - If only one is enabled, the respective index is used for filtering.
  - If both are enabled, `indexRangeFilters` is used for operations involving comparison operators, and `indexFilterable` is used for equality and inequality operations.

### Main Configuration

These parameters are set within the `invertedIndexConfig` object in your collection definition.

| Parameter             | Type    | Default                    | Details                                                                                                                                                            |
| :-------------------- | :------ | :------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bm25`                | Object  | `{ "k1": 1.2, "b": 0.75 }` | Sets the `k1` and `b` parameters for the BM25 ranking algorithm. Can be overridden at the property level. See [**BM25 Configuration**](#bm25-configuration) below. |
| `stopwords`           | Object  | (Varies)                   | Defines the stopword list to exclude common words from search queries. See [**Stopwords Configuration**](#stopwords-configuration) below.                          |
| `indexTimestamps`     | Boolean | `false`                    | If `true`, indexes object creation and update timestamps, enabling filtering by `creationTimeUnix` and `lastUpdateTimeUnix`.                                       |
| `indexNullState`      | Boolean | `false`                    | If `true`, indexes the null/non-null state of each property, enabling filtering for `null` values.                                                                 |
| `indexPropertyLength` | Boolean | `false`                    | If `true`, indexes the length of each property, enabling filtering by property length.                                                                             |

:::caution Performance Impact
Enabling `indexTimestamps`, `indexNullState`, or `indexPropertyLength` adds overhead as these additional indexes must be created and maintained. Only enable them if you require these specific filtering capabilities.

### `bm25`

Part of `invertedIndexConfig`. The settings for BM25 are the [free parameters `k1` and `b`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25#The_ranking_function), and they are optional. The defaults (`k1` = 1.2 and `b` = 0.75) work well for most cases.

They can be configured per collection, and can optionally be overridden per property:

```js
{
  "class": "Article",
  // Configuration of the sparse index
  "invertedIndexConfig": {
    "bm25": {
      "b": 0.75,
      "k1": 1.2
    }
  },
  "properties": [
    {
      "name": "title",
      "description": "title of the article",
      "dataType": [
        "text"
      ],
      // Property-level settings override the collection-level settings
      "invertedIndexConfig": {
        "bm25": {
          "b": 0.75,
          "k1": 1.2
        }
      },
      "indexFilterable": true,
      "indexSearchable": true,
    }
  ]
}
```

### `stopwords` (stopword lists)

Part of `invertedIndexConfig`. `text` properties may contain words that are very common and don't contribute to search results. Ignoring them speeds up queries that contain stopwords, as they can be automatically removed from queries as well. This speed up is very notable on scored searches, such as `BM25`.

The stopword configuration uses a preset system. You can select a preset to use the most common stopwords for a particular language (e.g. [`"en"` preset](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate/blob/main/adapters/repos/db/inverted/stopwords/presets.go)). If you need more fine-grained control, you can add additional stopwords or remove stopwords that you believe should not be part of the list. Alternatively, you can create your custom stopword list by starting with an empty (`"none"`) preset and adding all your desired stopwords as additions.

```json
  "invertedIndexConfig": {
    "stopwords": {
      "preset": "en",
      "additions": ["star", "nebula"],
      "removals": ["a", "the"]
    }
  }
```

This configuration allows stopwords to be configured by collection. If not set, these values are set to the following defaults:

| Parameter     | Default value | Acceptable values          |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------------------- |
| `"preset"`    | `"en"`        | `"en"`, `"none"`           |
| `"additions"` | `[]`          | _any list of custom words_ |
| `"removals"`  | `[]`          | _any list of custom words_ |

:::note

- If `preset` is `none`, then the collection only uses stopwords from the `additions` list.
- If the same item is included in both `additions` and `removals`, Weaviate returns an error.
  :::

As of `v1.18`, stopwords are indexed. Thus stopwords are included in the inverted index, but not in the tokenized query. As a result, when the BM25 algorithm is applied, stopwords are ignored in the input for relevance ranking but will affect the score.

Stopwords can now be configured at runtime. You can use the RESTful API to <SkipLink href="/weaviate/api/rest#tag/schema/put/schema/%7BclassName%7D">update</SkipLink> the list of stopwords after your data has been indexed.

Note that stopwords are only removed when [tokenization](#tokenization) is set to `word`.

Below is an example request on how to update the list of stopwords:

```python
import weaviate

client = weaviate.Client("http://localhost:8080")

collection_obj = {
    "invertedIndexConfig": {
        "stopwords": {
            "preset": "en",
            "additions": ["where", "is", "the"]
        }
    }
}

client.schema.update_config("Article", collection_obj)
```

### `indexTimestamps`

Part of `invertedIndexConfig`. To perform queries that are filtered by timestamps, configure the target collection to maintain an inverted index based on the objects' internal timestamps. Currently the timestamps include `creationTimeUnix` and `lastUpdateTimeUnix`.

To configure timestamp based indexing, set `indexTimestamps` to `true` in the `invertedIndexConfig` object.

```json
  "invertedIndexConfig": {
    "indexTimestamps": true
  }
```

### `indexNullState`

Part of `invertedIndexConfig`. To perform queries that filter on `null`, configure the target collection to maintain an inverted index that tracks `null` values for each property in a collection .

To configure `null` based indexing, setting `indexNullState` to `true` in the `invertedIndexConfig` object.

```json
  "invertedIndexConfig": {
    "indexNullState": true
  }
```

### `indexPropertyLength`

Part of `invertedIndexConfig`. To perform queries that filter by the length of a property, configure the target collection to maintain an inverted index based on the length of the properties.

To configure indexing based on property length, set `indexPropertyLength` to `true` in the `invertedIndexConfig` object.

```json
  "invertedIndexConfig": {
    "indexPropertyLength": true
  }
```

:::note
Using these features requires more resources. The additional inverted indexes must be created and maintained for the lifetime of the collection.
