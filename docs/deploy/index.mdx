# Deploying Weaviate

:::info[Section under construction!]

This is a new section being created, please bear with us as we add in new content!

:::

Weaviate offers multiple deployment options to satisfy your specific use case in production. 

This section hosts common deployment topics, including Kubernetes, cloud providers, and best practices, along with detailed tutorials and how-to guides.
Weaviate is designed for:

- **Scalability** – Handle billions of vector data points efficiently.
- **High-Performance Search** – Power AI applications with real-time vector retrieval.
- **Flexible Integrations** – Connect with various machine learning models and data sources.
- **Cloud & On-Prem Deployment** – Deploy on Weaviate Cloud, Kubernetes, or managed cloud services.
