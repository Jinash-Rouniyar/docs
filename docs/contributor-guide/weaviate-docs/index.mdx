This style guide provides a framework for creating clear, consistent, and user-friendly documentation for Weaviate. It emphasizes practical guidelines to help you write effectively for our audience.

---

## Content guidelines

### Audience

Our documentation serves **developers, data scientists, students, and Weaviate administrators** across various experience levels. When creating quickstart guides, we primarily focus on developers, data scientists, and students, while also considering system evaluators who may be assessing Weaviate for their organizations. We assume readers have **minimal knowledge of vector databases** and provide appropriate context and explanations to help them succeed.

### Voice & tone

Address readers directly using **second person ("you")** to create a personal, engaging experience. Maintain a **conversational, non-academic, and friendly tone** throughout all documentation. Avoid overly formal language that creates distance, but also steer clear of frivolous content that undermines credibility. **Adjust the assumed level of user knowledge** based on the specific page content, providing more foundational explanations in introductory materials and allowing for greater technical depth in advanced topics.

### Inclusion & accessibility

Follow **[Google's accessibility guidelines](https://developers.google.com/style/accessibility)** to ensure our documentation remains bias-free and respectful of all users, regardless of their background or identity. Prioritize creating **clear and useful documentation** that serves everyone, including users with disabilities.

**Key accessibility requirements:**
- Provide **meaningful alt text** for all images that summarizes their intent (use empty alt text only for purely decorative images)
- Use **descriptive headings and titles** that clearly indicate content structure and purpose

## Structural & organizational principles

### Types of documentation pages

Categorize content using these types:

- **Concept:** Explains fundamental ideas and principles.
- **Guides (how-to):** Provides step-by-step instructions to achieve a specific goal.
- **Reference:** Offers detailed information about APIs, configurations, and technical specifications.
- **Tutorial:** Guides users through a complete process, often combining concepts and guides.

### Docusaurus structure

The documentation is organized into key sections. When contributing, understand where your content fits:

- **Weaviate database (`/docs/weaviate`):** Get started, How-to manuals & guides, Model integrations, Reference & APIs, Concepts, Recipes, Other (Release notes, Benchmarks, Modules, FAQ, Glossary, Example datasets).
- **Deploy (`/docs/deploy`):** Get started, Configuration, Production guides, Tutorials, FAQs, Migration.
- **Weaviate agents (`/docs/agents`):** Documentation, Recipes.
- **Weaviate cloud (`/docs/cloud`):** Get started, Weaviate embeddings, Account management.
- **Academy (`/docs/academy`):** Get started.
- **Integrations (`/docs/integrations`):** Integrations for working with Weaviate.
- **Contributor guide (`/docs/contributor-guide`):** Get started, Weaviate database, Weaviate modules, Weaviate clients, Contextionary.

### Page layout

- **Top-level headings:** Do not include redundant top-level headings like "Introduction" or "Overview" within the body content; the page title serves this purpose.
- **Related pages:** Place links to related pages at the **bottom of the page** within a `:::info Further resources` block.
- **Quickstart guides:**
  - Include links to environment setup guides.
  - Provide **complete, runnable example code** requiring minimal edits.
  - Focus on demonstrating VDB functionality, not installation or general system setup.

## Formatting & presentation rules

### Text elements

- **Capitalization:** Use **sentence case for all headings**.
  - _Example:_ `## This is a heading about Weaviate`
- **Lists:**
  - Transform "cascading sentences disguised as lists" into proper lists.
  - Use **numbered lists for sequences**.
  - Use **bulleted lists for most other lists**.
  - Use **description lists for pairs of related data**.
- **Headings hierarchy:**
  - Use Markdown for headings: `## Section title`, `### Subsection title`, `#### Sub-subsection title`.
  - Do not skip heading levels (e.g., go directly from `##` to `####`).
  - Be aware that H4 and lower headings may not appear in the right-hand-side table of contents.
- **Code & UI elements:**
  - Use **code font** for all code-related text.
  - Use **bold** for UI elements.
- **Dates:** Use **unambiguous date formats**.
- **Punctuation:** Use **serial commas**.
- **American English:** Assume **US style for dates, numbers, and dialect for English spelling and usage**. Write for a global audience.

## Terminology & linking

### Terminology

- **General:** Use clear, direct language. Define acronyms and abbreviations on first use.
- **Specific terms (pending definition):** Decisions are pending for the precise usage of:
  - `query` vs. `search`
  - `filter`, `threshold`, `(.with_limit)`
  - `method`, `operator`, `function` (e.g., `functionMethodOrOperator.whatDoWecallThisPart()`)

### Term linking

- On the **first mention** of a Weaviate method or term on a page, **link to its corresponding reference or concept page**.

## Visual assets & versioning

### Visual assets

- **Screenshots:** **Avoid using screenshots** due to maintenance challenges.
- **Diagrams:** Diagrams are acceptable where they add clarity.
- **Videos:** Videos can supplement written documentation but should **not replace it**. Ensure videos are kept up-to-date as the UI evolves.
- **Dark/light mode images:**

  - For simple images, use Markdown suffixes:
    ```markdown
    ![Light mode image](./_includes/image_light.png#gh-light-mode-only)
    ![Dark mode image](./_includes/image_dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only)
    ```
  - For images requiring width adjustment, use the Docusaurus `ThemedImage` component:

    ```jsx
    import ThemedImage from "@theme/ThemedImage";
    import MyImageLight from "./_img/my_image_light.png";
    import MyImageDark from "./_img/my_image_dark.png";

    <ThemedImage
      alt="My image alt text"
      sources={{
        light: MyImageLight,
        dark: MyImageDark,
      }}
      width="300"
    />;
    ```

- **Social/preview images:** Use the `image:` frontmatter for social media previews.

### Versioning

- Indicate **new features** with a version tag: 

:::info Added in version `vX.Y.Z`
:::

- For features in **technical preview**, use a caution block to warn users:

:::caution Technical preview

`<FEATURE_NAME>` was added in **`v1.32`** as a **technical preview**.<br/><br/> 
This means that the feature is still under development and may change in future releases, including potential breaking changes.
**We do not recommend using this feature in production environments at this time.**
